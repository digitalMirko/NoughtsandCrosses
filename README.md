# NoughtsandCrosses
App created in Android Studio 2.2.2 and tested on a Nexus 5 Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition 
Android phone. Minimum SDK: API15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwhich)

Android Tic-Tac-Toe Game app

As the player opens up the app they are greeted on top by a title 'Noughts and Crosses'. Then right below the player will see a 
blank blue 3 x 3 Tic-Tac-Toe Grid. The background is composed of a Orange/Yellow abstract splash background to help pop out the 
two game letters ('X','O') in play. 

To start just select an open spot on the Grid. The first letter is a green letter 'X'. The next is followed by a red letter 'O'. 
The font's have a brush look to them. The rules for the game are simple the player who succeeds in putting three of their
letters in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before the other wins the game. But if neither succeed its a draw.

There are three options in the game. Options include:

1. "X has won!", 'PLAY AGAIN' button.

2. "O has won!", 'PLAY AGAIN' button.

1. "It's a draw!", 'PLAY AGAIN' button.

Once the game is over there are no more options to add pieces to the board. When the player clicks the 'PLAY AGAIN' button the game
resets it self to a blank blue 3 x 3 Tic-Tac-Toe Grid that is ready to play again.

A Simple easy to use app to play with.
